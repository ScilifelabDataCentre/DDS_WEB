# Database Migration Guide

This document explains how to perform database migrations for this project. In DDS we use Alembic leveraged through flask-migrate.

## Steps for Running Migrations

### 1. Start the Containers

Before making any model changes, ensure the containers are running locally.

### 2. Modify the Database Models

Edit the `models.py` file to reflect the changes you need. This might include:

- Adding new tables or columns
- Modifying existing fields
- Deleting tables or columns

### 3. Access the Backend Container

Connect a terminal into the backend container.

### 4. Run the Migration Command

Inside the container, execute the migration command:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Your migration message"
```

### 5. Review the Generated Migration File

A new migration script will be generated in the `migrations/versions` directory. **Review this file carefully** to ensure it correctly represents your intended changes.

For reference on available operations and customization options, check the [Alembic Documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/ops.html).

### 6. Commit the Migration File

Finally, commit the migration script to version control.
